# cwenanngeor

A LISP dialect with static typechecking and compileable and can interface with go. Early stage.
See the `dev.base` branch for as `master` branch is reserved for releases. 

The ultimate goal is to write a minimum viable compiler in Go and then start working on a Cwenanngeor compiler in Cwenanngeor. The go version
should be seen as a bootstrapping compiler - nothing more.
